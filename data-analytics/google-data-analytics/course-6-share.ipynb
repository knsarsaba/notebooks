    "#### Understand data visualization\n",
    "- Rule for creating data visualization\n",
    "    - Your audience should know exactly what they're looking at within the first five seconds of seeing it\n",
    "    - This means the visual should be clear and easy to follow. In the five seconds after that, your audience should understand the conclusion your visualization is making\n",
    "- They might not agree with your conclusion, and that's okay. You can always use their feedback to adjust your visualization and go back to the data to do further analysis\n",
    "- Four elements of successful visualization\n",
    "    - Information (data)\n",
    "    - Story (concept)\n",
    "    - Goal (function)\n",
    "    - Visual form (metaphor)\n",
    "- Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization\n",
    "    - Frameworks help organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference as you plan and evaluate your data visualization\n",
    "- [The McCandless method](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-makes-a-good-data-visualization/)\n",
    "    - Four elements:\n",
    "        - Information: the data with which you’re working\n",
    "        - Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept\n",
    "        - Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual\n",
    "        - Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression\n",
    "    - Provides terminology that isolates the specific elements of a graphic, allowing the person making a visual the ability to evaluate how well those criteria have been met\n",
    "    - Visualizations that fail to incorporate all four elements can be ineffective at communicating insights in various ways\n",
    "        - Visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art\n",
    "        - Data in visual form without a goal or function is just a pretty picture\n",
    "        - Data with a goal but no story or visual form can be boring\n",
    "- [Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts trifecta checkup](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html)\n",
    "    - This approach is a set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is\n",
    "    - Questions to determine if your data visualization is effective\n",
    "        - What is the practical question?\n",
    "        - What does the data say?\n",
    "        - What does the visual say?\n",
    "- Pre-attentive attributes\n",
    "    - Creating effective visuals means leveraging what is known about how the brain works, and then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively\n",
    "    - Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically and without conscious effort\n",
    "    - The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels\n",
    "    - Marks\n",
    "        - Are basic visual objects such as points, lines, and shapes\n",
    "        - Every mark can be broken down into four qualities\n",
    "            - Position\n",
    "                - Where is a specific mark in space relative to a scale or to other marks?\n",
    "                - For example, if you’re looking at two different trends, position allows you to compare the pattern of one element relative to another\n",
    "            - Size\n",
    "                - How big, small, long, or tall is a mark?\n",
    "                - The comparison of object sizes can be an easy visual interpretation for humans\n",
    "                - This can be very useful for conveying the relationship between categories or data points\n",
    "                - However, this also presents a potential problem: The human eye can inadvertently interpret comparisons that aren’t intended to convey meaning. For example, sometimes objects that appear to be the same size when they are not. Controlling the scale of a visual is important even when comparative sizes are not intended to offer information.\n",
    "            - Shape\n",
    "                - Does the shape of a specific object communicate something about it?\n",
    "                - Rather than using simple dots or lines, a bit of creativity can enhance how quickly people are able to interpret a visual by using shapes that align with a given application\n",
    "            - Color\n",
    "                - What color is a mark?\n",
    "                - Colors can be used both as a simple differentiator of groupings or as a way to communicate other concepts such as profitable versus unprofitable, or hot versus cold\n",
    "    - Channels\n",
    "        - Are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data in a visualization\n",
    "        - They are basically specialized marks that have been used to visualize data\n",
    "        - It’s important to understand that channels vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements:\n",
    "            - Accuracy\n",
    "                - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?\n",
    "                - For example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, such as apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data, such as 5 from 5.5\n",
    "            - Popout\n",
    "                - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others?\n",
    "                - There are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and lots of them leverage pre-attentive attributes including line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity\n",
    "            - Grouping\n",
    "                - How effective is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?\n",
    "                - Consider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel\n",
    "- Remember: The more you emphasize one single thing, the more that counts. Emphasis diminishes with each item you emphasize because the items begin to compete with one another\n",
    "- Bar graph / Column chart\n",
    "    - Use size contrast to compare two or more values\n",
    "    - X-axis (horizontal) is used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables\n",
    "    - Y-axis (vertical) is a scale of values for the variables\n",
    "    - Bar charts with horizontal bars effectively show data that are ranked with bars arranged in ascending or descending order\n",
    "    - Bar chart should always be ranked by value unless there's a natural order to the data like age or time\n",
    "- Line graph / Line chart\n",
    "    - Help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data\n",
    "    - Used to track changes through a period of time\n",
    "- Pie chart\n",

    "    - Can hold location-based information\n",
    "- Histogram\n",
    "    - A chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges\n",
    "- Correlation charts\n",
    "    - Show relationships among data\n",
    "    - Should be used with caution because they might lead viewers to think that the data shows causation\n",
    "    - Causation occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome\n",
    "- Heatmap\n",
    "    - Use color to compare categories in a data set\n",
    "    - They are mainly used to show relationships between two variables and use a system of color-coding to represent different values\n",
    "- Scatterplot\n",
    "    - Show relationships between different variables\n",
    "    - Typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed\n",
    "    - For example, you might want to show data of the relationship between temperature changes and ice cream sales\n",
    "- Distribution graph\n",
    "    - Displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset\n",
    "    - Example: To account for its supplies, a brand new coffee shop owner wants to measure how many cups of coffee their customers consume, and they want to know if that information is dependent on the days and times of the week\n",
    "- Meaningful patterns can take many forms, such as:\n",
    "    - Change\n",
    "        - This is a trend or instance of observations that become different over time. A great way to measure change in data is through a line or column chart\n",
    "    - Clustering\n",
    "        - A collection of data points with similar or different values. This is best represented through a distribution graph\n",
    "    - Relativity\n",
    "        - These are observations considered in relation or in proportion to something else. You have probably seen examples of relativity data in a pie chart\n",
    "    - Ranking\n",
    "        - This is a position in a scale of achievement or status. Data that requires ranking is best represented by a column chart\n",
    "    - Correlation\n",
    "        - This shows a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A scatterplot is an excellent way to represent this type of data pattern\n",

    "- One of the biggest considerations when creating data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus\n",
    "- As a general rule, as long as it's not misleading, you should visually represent only the data that your audience needs in order to understand your findings\n",
    "- Correlation and causation\n",
    "    - Correlation\n",
    "        - In statistics, is the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other\n",
    "        - An example of correlation is the idea that “As the temperature goes up, ice cream sales also go up.”\n",
    "        - It is important to remember that correlation doesn’t mean that one event causes another. But, it does indicate that they have a pattern with or a relationship to each other\n",
    "        - If one variable goes up and the other variable also goes up, it is a positive correlation\n",
    "        - If one variable goes up and the other variable goes down, it is a negative or inverse correlation\n",
    "        - If one variable goes up and the other variable stays about the same, there is no correlation\n",
    "    - Causation\n",
    "        - Refers to the idea that an event leads to a specific outcome\n",
    "        - For example, when lightning strikes, we hear the thunder (sound wave) caused by the air heating and cooling from the lightning strike. Lightning causes thunder.\n",
    "    - Why is differentiating between correlation and causation important?\n",
    "        - When you make conclusions from data analysis, you need to make sure that you don’t assume a causal relationship between elements of your data when there is only a correlation\n",
    "        - When your data shows that outdoor temperature and ice cream consumption both go up at the same time, it might be tempting to conclude that hot weather causes people to eat ice cream. But, a closer examination of the data would reveal that every change in temperature doesn’t lead to a change in ice cream purchases. In addition, there might have been a sale on ice cream at the same time that the data was collected, which might not have been considered in your analysis.\n",
    "        - Knowing the difference between correlation and causation is important when you make conclusions from your data since the stakes could be high.\n",
    "        - The next two examples illustrate the high stakes to health and human services\n",
    "            - Cause of disease\n",
    "                - For example, pellagra is a disease with symptoms of dizziness, sores, vomiting, and diarrhea. In the early 1900s, people thought that the disease was caused by unsanitary living conditions. Most people who got pellagra also lived in unsanitary environments. But, a closer examination of the data showed that pellagra was the result of a lack of niacin (Vitamin B3). Unsanitary conditions were related to pellagra because most people who couldn’t afford to purchase niacin-rich foods also couldn’t afford to live in more sanitary conditions. But, dirty living conditions turned out to be a correlation only\n",
    "            - Distribution of aid\n",
    "                - Here is another example. Suppose you are working for a government agency that provides SNAP benefits. You noticed from the agency’s Google Analytics that people who qualify for the benefits are browsing the official website, but they are leaving the site without signing up for benefits. You think that the people visiting the site are leaving because they aren’t finding the information they need to sign up for SNAP benefits. Google Analytics can help you find clues (correlations), like the same people coming back many times or how quickly people leave the page. One of those correlations might lead you to the actual cause, but you will need to collect additional data, like in a survey, to know exactly why people coming to the site aren’t signing up for SNAP benefits. Only then can you figure out how to increase the sign-up rate\n",
    "        - Key takeaways\n",
    "            - Critically analyze any correlations that you find\n",
    "            - Examine the data’s context to determine if a causation makes sense (and can be supported by all of the data)\n",
    "            - Understand the limitations of the tools that you use for analysis\n",
    "- Static visualization\n",
    "    - Do not change over time unless they're edited\n",
    "- Dynamic visualization\n",
    "    - Visualization that are interactive or change over time\n",
    "- Tableau\n",
    "    - A business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data\n",
    "- Decision tree\n",
    "    - Decision-making tool that allows you, the data analyst, to make decisions based on key questions that you can ask yourself\n",
    "    - Each question in the visualization decision tree will help you make a decision about critical features for your visualization\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - Which story would you like to tell?\n",
    "            - Does your data have only one numeric variable?\n",
    "                - Histogram\n",
    "                - Density plot\n",
    "            - Are there multiple datasets?\n",
    "                - Line chart\n",
    "                - Pie chart\n",
    "            - Are you measuring changes over time?\n",
    "                - Bar chart\n",
    "            - Do relationships between the data need to be shown?\n",
    "                - Scatter plot\n",
    "                - Heatmap\n",
    "    - Start off by evaluating the type of data you have and go through a series of questions to determine the best visual source\n",
    "        - Does your data have only one numeric variable? \n",
    "            - If you have data that has one, continuous, numerical variable, then a histogram or density plot are the best methods of plotting your categorical data\n",
    "            - Depending on your type of data, a bar chart can even be appropriate in this case. For example, if you have data pertaining to the height of a group of students, you will want to use a histogram to visualize how many students there are in each height range\n",
    "        - Are there multiple datasets?\n",
    "            - For cases dealing with more than one set of data, consider a line or pie chart for accurate representation of your data\n",
    "            - A line chart will connect multiple data sets over a single, continuous line, showing how numbers have changed over time\n",
    "            - A pie chart is good for dividing a whole into multiple categories or parts\n",
    "            - An example of this is when you are measuring quarterly sales figures of your company\n",
    "        - Are you measuring changes over time?\n",
    "            - A line chart is usually adequate for plotting trends over time\n",
    "            - However, when the changes are larger, a bar chart is the better option\n",
    "        - Do relationships between the data need to be shown?\n",
    "            - When you have two variables for one set of data, it is important to point out how one affects the other\n",
    "            - Variables that pair well together are best plotted on a scatterplot\n",
    "            - However, if there are too many data points, the relationship between variables can be obscured so a heat map can be a better representation in that case\n",
    "            - If you are measuring the population of people across all 50 states in the United States, your data points would consist of millions so you would use a heat map\n",

    "    - Balance\n",
    "        - When the key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly\n",
    "    - Emphasis\n",
    "        - Your data visualization should have a focal point, so that your audience knows where to concentrate\n",
    "        - Your visualizations should emphasize the most important data so that users recognize it first\n",
    "        - Using color and value is one effective way to make this happen\n",
    "        - By using contrasting colors, you can make certain that graphic elements—and the data shown in those elements—stand out\n",
    "    - Movement\n",
    "        - Movement can refer to the path the viewer’s eye travels as they look at a data visualization, or literal movement created by animations\n",
    "        - Movement in data visualization should mimic the way people usually read. You can use lines and colors to pull the viewer’s attention across the page\n",
    "    - Pattern\n",
    "        - You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization\n",
    "        - This can be useful in a lot of different ways. For example, you can use patterns to highlight similarities between different data sets, or break up a pattern with a unique shape, color, or line to create more emphasis\n",
    "    - Repetition\n",
    "        - Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization\n",
    "    - Proportion\n",
    "        - Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data\n",
    "        - Using various colors and sizes helps demonstrate that you are calling attention to a specific visual over others\n",
    "        - If you make one chart in a dashboard larger than the others, then you are calling attention to it\n",
    "        - It is important to make sure that each chart accurately reflects and visualizes the relationship among the values in it\n",
    "    - Rhythm\n",
    "        - This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization\n",
    "        - Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle\n",
    "        - If your finished design doesn’t successfully create a flow, you might want to rearrange some of the elements to improve the rhythm\n",
    "    - Variety\n",
    "        - Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use\n",
    "        - Variety keeps the audience engaged\n",
    "        - But it is good to find balance since too much variety can confuse people\n",
    "        - The variety you include should make your dashboards and other visualizations feel interesting and unified\n",
    "    - Unity\n",
    "        - This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive\n",
    "        -  the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming\n",
    "- Choosing the right visualization\n",
    "    - Which one will make it easiest for the user to understand the point you're trying to make?\n",

    "    - You can use dimensions to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data\n",
    "    - Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view\n",
    "- Measures\n",
    "    - Contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure\n",
    "    - Measures can be aggregated\n",
    "    - When you drag a measure into the view, Tableau applies an aggregation to that measure (by default)\n",
    "- Key takeaways\n",
    "    - Tableau allows you to customize measures with options such as Color, Size, and Label, which change those aspects of the measure’s visualization on the chart\n",
    "    - As you customize measures in Tableau, you will want to consider accessibility for your audience\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design visualizations in Tableau\n",
    "- Diverging color pallete\n",
    "    - Displays two ranges of values using color intensity to show the magnitude of the number and the actual color to show which range the number is from\n",
    "    - It's a good way to show the difference between numbers\n",
    "- Essential design principles\n",
    "    - Choose the right visual\n",
    "        - One of the first things you have to decide is which visual will be the most effective for your audience\n",
    "        - Sometimes, a simple table is the best visualization. Other times, you need a more complex visualization to illustrate your point\n",
    "    - Optimize the data-ink ratio\n",
    "        - The data-ink entails focusing on the part of the visual that is essential to understanding the point of the chart\n",
    "        - Try to minimize non-data ink like boxes around legends or shadows to optimize the data-ink ratio\n",
    "    - Use orientation effectively\n",
    "        - Make sure the written components of the visual, like the labels on a bar chart, are easy to read\n",
    "        - You can change the orientation of your visual to make it easier to read and understand\n",
    "    - Color\n",
    "        - There are a lot of important considerations when thinking about using color in your visuals\n",
    "        - These include using color consciously and meaningfully, staying consistent throughout your visuals, being considerate of what colors mean to different people, and using inclusive color scales that make sense for everyone viewing them\n",
    "    - Numbers of elements\n",
    "        - Think about how many elements you include in any visual\n",
    "        - If your visualization uses lines, try to plot five or fewer\n",
    "        - If that isn’t possible, use color or hue to emphasize important lines\n",
    "        - Also, when using visuals like pie charts, try to keep the number of segments to less than seven since too many elements can be distracting\n",
    "- Avoiding misleading or deceptive charts\n",
    "    - As you are considering what kind of visualization to create and how to design it, you will also want to be sure that you are not creating misleading or deceptive charts\n",
    "    - Data analysis provides insights and knowledge that people use to make decisions. So, it’s important that the visualizations you create are communicating data insights accurately and truthfully\n",
    "- Common errors to avoid so that your visualizations aren’t accidentally misleading\n",
    "    - Cutting off the y-axis\n",
    "        - Changing the scale on the y-axis can make the differences between different groups in your data seem more dramatic, even if the difference is actually quite small\n",
    "    - Misleading use of a dual y-axis\n",
    "        - Using a dual y-axis without clearly labeling it in your data visualization can create extremely misleading charts\n",
    "    - Artificially limiting the scope of the data\n",
    "        - If you only consider the part of the data that confirms your analysis, your visualizations will be misleading because they don’t take all of the data into account\n",
    "    - Problematic choices in how data is binned or grouped\n",
    "        - It is important to make sure that the way you are grouping data isn’t misleading or misrepresenting your data and disguising important trends and insights\n",
    "    - Using part-to-whole visuals when the totals do not sum up appropriately\n",
    "        - If you are using a part-to-whole visual like a pie chart to explain your data, the individual parts should add up to equal 100%. If they don’t, your data visualization will be misleading\n",
    "    - Hiding trends in cumulative charts\n",
    "        - Creating a cumulative chart can disguise more insightful trends by making the scale of the visualization too large to track any changes over time\n",
    "    - Artificially smoothing trends\n",
    "        - Adding smooth trend lines between points in a scatter plot can make it easier to read that plot, but replacing the points with just the line can actually make it appear that the point is more connected over time than it actually was\n",
    "- Key takeaways\n",
    "    - Design principles are important for creating effective data visualizations\n",
    "    - When creating visualizations, consider the audience, choose the right visual for the job, and be sure to avoid misleading or deceptive visuals\n",
    "    - By following these principles, you’ll be able to design visualizations that are effective, informative, and easy to understand, which will help you communicate findings to a wider audience and make a greater impact on your organization\n",
    "- Few rules about what makes a helpful data visualization\n",
    "    - Five-second rule\n",
    "        - A data visualization should be clear, effective, and convincing enough to be absorbed in five seconds or less\n",
    "    - Color contrast\n",
    "        - Graphs and charts should use a diverging color palette to show contrast between elements\n",
    "    - Conventions and expectations\n",
    "        - Visuals and their organization should align with audience expectations and cultural conventions\n",
    "        - For example, if the majority of your audience associates green with a positive concept and red with a negative one, your visualization should reflect this\n",
    "    - Minimal labels\n",
    "        - Titles, axes, and annotations should use as few labels as it takes to make sense\n",
    "        - Having too many labels makes your graph or chart too busy. It takes up too much space and prevents the labels from being shown clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional: Work with multiple data sources\n",
    "- Joining\n",
    "    - Refers to the process of combining data sources based on common fields\n",
    "    - https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/joining_tables.htm\n",
    "- Relationships\n",
    "    - Allow you to combine multiple data sources in Tableau\n",
    "    - This is a more flexible alternative to joins, and doesn’t force you to create one single table with your multiple data sources\n",

    "    - https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/datasource_relationships_learnmorepage.htm\n",
    "- Data blending\n",
    "    - Another method you can use to combine multiple data sources\n",
    "    - Instead of truly combining the data, blends allow you to query and aggregate data from multiple sources.\n",
    "    - https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiple_connections.htm\n",
