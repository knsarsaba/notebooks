    "    - Understanding the context behind the data can help us make it more meaningful at every stage of the data analysis process\n",
    "    - Can turn raw data into meaningful information\n",

    "- Working with stakeholders\n",
    "    - Your data analysis project should answer the business task and create opportunities for data-driven decision-making\n",
    "    - It is your responsibility to understand and manage your stakeholders’ expectations while keeping the project goals front and center\n",
    "- Three common stakeholder groups\n",
    "    - Executive team\n",
    "    - Customer-facing team\n",
    "    - Data science team\n",
    "- Executive team\n",
    "    - Provides strategic and operational leadership to the company\n",
    "    - They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively\n",
    "    - Might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work\n",
    "    - These stakeholders think about decisions at a very high level and they are looking for the headline news about your project first\n",
    "    - They are less interested in the details\n",
    "    - Time is very limited with them, so make the most of it by leading your presentations with the answers to their questions\n",
    "    - You can keep the more detailed information handy in your presentation appendix or your project documentation for them to dig into when they have more time\n",
    "    - Part of your job will be balancing what information they will need to make informed decisions with their busy schedule\n",
    "- Consumer-facing team\n",
    "    - Includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers\n",
    "    - They compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization\n",
    "    - It is important to let the data tell the story and not be swayed by asks from your stakeholders to find certain patterns that might not exist\n",
    "    - Focus on what is actually in the data-- not on what your stakeholders hope to find\n",
    "- Working effectively with stakeholders\n",
    "    - Discuss goals\n",
    "        - When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more\n",
    "        - Start a discussion\n",
    "        - Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants\n",
    "        - Quick chat about goals can help set expectations and plan the next steps\n",
    "    - Feel empowered to say “no.”\n",
    "        - Don’t be afraid to push back when you need to\n",
    "        - Stakeholders don’t always realize the time and effort that goes into collecting and analyzing data\n",
    "        - Stakeholders also might not know what they actually need\n",
    "        - When your stakeholders understand what needs to be done and what can be accomplished in a given timeline, they will usually be comfortable resetting their expectations\n",
    "        - You should feel empowered to say no-- just remember to give context so others understand why\n",
    "    - Plan for the unexpected\n",
    "        - Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks\n",
    "        - When you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process\n",

    "        - If you have a good understanding about why you are doing an analysis, it can help you connect your work with other goals and be more effective at solving larger problems. \n",
    "    - Start with words and visuals\n",
    "        - To help avoid the illusion of agreement, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey\n",
    "        - Stakeholders have many points of view and may prefer to absorb information in words or pictures\n",
    "        - The faster everyone agrees, the faster you can perform the first analysis to test the usefulness of the project, measure the feedback, learn from the data, and implement changes\n",
    "    - Communicate often\n",
    "        - Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects\n",
    "        - Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes\n",

    "    - How you can communicate that effectively to them\n",
    "- Learn as you go and ask questions\n",
    "- Practice good writing habits\n",
    "    - Write complete sentences\n",
    "    - Proper spelling and punctuation\n",
    "    - Write clearly enough so that anyone could understand you\n",
    "- Read your emails out loud before sending\n",
    "- Rule of thumb - would you be proud of what you have written if it were published on the front page of a newspaper? If not, revise it until you are.\n",
    "- Avoid long emails\n",
    "    - Think about what they need to know\n",
    "    - Get to the point instead of overwhelming them with a wall of text\n",
    "    - Should be clear and concise\n",
    "- Answer in a timely manner\n",
    "    - 24 - 48 hours\n",
    "- Being clear about what you need is part of being a good communicator\n",
    "- Being able to communicate in multiple formats is a key skill for data analysts\n",
    "- Listening, speaking, presenting, and writing skills will help you succeed in your projects and in your career\n",
    "- Good communication keeps stakeholders updated on progress and ultimately helps prevent problems\n",
    "- Carefully worded responses are key\n",
    "- Fastest answer and most accurate answer aren't usually the same answer\n",
    "- Balance speed and accuracy by making sure you understanding their needs and setting expectations clearly\n",
    "- Limitations of data\n",
    "    - Has someone’s personal opinion found its way into the numbers?\n",
    "    - Is your data telling the whole story?\n",
    "    - Part of being a great data analyst is knowing the limits of data and planning for them\n",
    "    - The case of incomplete (or nonexistent) data\n",
    "        - You might realize during an analysis that you don't have enough data to reach a conclusion\n",
    "        - You might even be solving a different problem altogether\n",
    "        - You will need to make the limits of your analysis clear\n",
    "        - You should be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available\n",
    "    - Don't miss misaligned data\n",
    "        - If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules\n",
    "        - Establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between teams are meaningful and insightful.\n",
    "    - Deal with dirty data\n",
    "        - Refers to data that contains errors\n",
    "        - Can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making\n",
    "    - Tell a clear story\n",
    "        - Compare the same types of data \n",
    "            - Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization\n",
    "            - Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics\n",
    "        - Visualize with care\n",
    "            - A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough\n",
    "            - To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0\n",
    "        - Leave out needless graphs\n",
    "            - If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph\n",
    "            - Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity\n",
    "        - Test for statistical significance\n",
    "            - Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important\n",
    "            - So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference\n",
    "        - Pay attention to sample size\n",
    "            - Gather lots of data\n",
    "            - If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results\n",
    "            - If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments\n",
    "            - Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods\n",
    "    - Be the judge\n",
    "        - A big part of a data analyst’s role is making sound judgments\n",
    "        - When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data\n",
    "        - Data is an extremely powerful tool for decision-making, but if it is incomplete, misaligned, or hasn’t been cleaned, then it can be misleading\n",
    "        - Take the necessary steps to make sure that your data is complete and consistent\n",
    "        - Clean the data before you begin your analysis to save yourself and possibly others a great amount of time and effort\n",
    "- Data cleaning\n",
    "    - The process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset\n",
